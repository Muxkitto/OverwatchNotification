# OverwatchNotification
 A desktop application that runs in the background and sends you a text message notification when your overwatch games are found. Upon starting the program, it will constantly run in the background until you stop it or shutdown/restart your computer. It can be run during your whole gaming session without introducing lag and will send you a text notification when every game you queue for is found.
